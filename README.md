# K I K O F R I

Kikofri is a theme for Jekyll that's a fork of the [Kiko theme][1] It came
about because I like my themes like I like my music: ugly, old and barren. It's
an assortment of hacks filtered through web-design choices from the turn of the
millennium.

More information about the theme and it's quirks can be found [here][2.1]. A
lot of stuff has changed since the last update, '[Kikofri Classic][2.3]' if you
will. Even more importantly, a lot of junk got dumped and other junk got
simplified.

You'll see it undead [here][2.2].

## To do:

* What amounts to "bug-fixes", not much else
* Listen to Good Friendly Violent Fun by Exodus

## How to:

1. Fork or clone this repository,
2. Run it: `jekyll s`
3. If that doesn't work see `General pointers`.

### General pointers:

* If you use GitHub you might want to add `gh-pages` in the Gemfile in addition
  to consulting the [Jekyll documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/).
* Various stuff, like indentation with `µµ`, can be used.
  `µ#[somelink][someref]#µ` creates Wikipedia-Style references. I call these
  liquid tweaks [micros][3].
* Tags can be sorted first under `/tags` by making the first letter an
  Upper-case one in the post's front matter
    - To sort something last make the first letter a lower-case one 
    - To just sort tags alphabetically use only upper- or lower-case letter
      consistently throughout posts

## Make it a little less ugly:

1. Change the name and modify nav at `_config.yml`.
2. Make some appropriate changes — or inappropriate if you're into those kind
of things — in `about.md`.
3. Navigate to the `_posts` directory and remove the example content by writing
   `rm *` in your terminal window. (Make sure that you're in the right folder)
   Might want to do the same under `assets/images`.
   - While you're at it create a post under `_posts/REAL-DA-TE.md` with some
     front matter similar to this:
   ```
   title:       "Friends Don't Lie."
   description: "No more."
   author:      "Eleven"
   layout:      post
   ```
4. Type away! Reject my reality and substitute your own!

## Want to contribute?

There's no "protocol" for contributing. Noticed that some people actually
forked this repository/theme, I always found that to be unlikely. Anyway,
_there is **some**_ room for improvement. So here it goes:

* Contributions are appreciated. 
* _Keep it ugly_.
* When possible keep line length to 79 characters per line, like the
  recommendations for [Python Code][4].
